## 🌳 IOTA Smart Contracts Initiative

The **IOTA Smart Contracts Initiative** is a collaborative effort to help people in the IOTA Community by introducing consistent workflows around [IOTA ISCP](https://blog.iota.org/iota-smart-contracts-pre-alpha-released-40efad27994b/) with content, and open source contributions.

IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger technology that allows [connected devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_Devices) to transfer data and [IOTA tokens](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/clients/token) among each other for zero fees.

## 🎯 Initiative Goals

The IOTA Smart Contracts is in the Alpha phase. We are currently focused on improving the IOTA Experience around the following goals:

- We are collecting Frequently Asked Questions, and want to provide answers to them. This is why we need you to help us by asking questions!
- Documentation
- Code samples development
- Improvements to module/libraries

### Quality Assurance/Review

Quality Assurance/Review goal includes making sure that the releases are easily usable, has no obvious bugs or pitfalls that might turn developers off from trying further once they run into them, make sure that the examples we provide are clear and work for the most common use cases the release is aimed at.
